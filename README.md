# somnolence-detection
ABSTRACT :
			This work presents the development to alert people when they are in state of near sleep where the person has a strong desire for sleep. This system mainly focused to develop ADAS (advanced driving assistance system) to detect where a person is feeling drowsy or not. Driver drowsiness is the most critical cause of traffic accidents, thus this somnolence detection system plays a vital role in preventing traffic accidents, whose objective is to develop an automatic solution for alerting people, before an accident occurs, this could reduce the number of traffic accidents. Therefore, this research proposes a real-time detection approach for driver drowsiness. This somnolence detection system is not only used for driver drowsiness it can also use for a software employes when they feel stress due to lack of adequate sleep and free time, this is a highly underrated cause of software engineer fatigue and also used in many more situations like this. The proposed approach has two phases: image processing and deep learning. The role of image processing phase is to recognize the face of the people and then extracts the images of the eyes and mouth of the user. The role of the deep learning is to classify either the eyes of the person are closed or opened and it checks whether the person is yawning or not using technology of dlib which uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). If the result of the classification indicates that the person’s eyes are closed for a pre-defined period of time and person’s mouth is opened for a pre-defined of time the person will be considered as feeling drowsy, hence an alarm will be started to alert the person. Thus, it can be concluded that the proposed approach is an effective solution method for a real-time of somnolence detection.

INTRODUCTION :
      Somnolence refers to feeling more sleepy than normal during the day. It has two distinct meanings, referring both to the usual state preceding falling asleep and the chronic condition referring to being in that state independent of a daily rhythm. Somnolence can be dangerous when performing tasks that require constant concentration, such as driving a vehicle, monitoring an event. When a person is sufficiently fatigue while performing a task, they will experience drowsiness and this leads to increase the factor of loss to that task.
The aim of this project is to develop a Somnolence detection system. The focus will be placed on designing a system that will accurately monitor the open or closed state of the user’s eyes and mouth. By monitoring the eyes, it is believed that the symptoms of user's somnolence can be detected in sufficiently early stage, to avoid unexpected situations. Yawn detection is a method to assess the user’s fatigue. When a person is fatigue, they keep yawning to ensure that there is enough oxygen for the brain consumption before going to somnolence state. Detection of fatigue and drowsiness involves the observation of eyes and mouth open or closed duration in a face.
The analysis of facial expressions is a popular research area with applications such as face recognition, and human identification and tracking for security systems. This project is focused on the localization of the eyes and mouth, which involves looking at the entire image of the face which is captured by the camera sensor, and determining the position of the eyes and mouth. Once the position of the eyes is located, the system is designed to determine whether the eyes and mouth are opened or closed, and detect fatigue and Somnolence.
Existing drowsiness detection systems monitoring the driver’s condition requires complex computation and expensive equipment, not comfortable to wear during driving and is not suitable for driving conditions. A somnolence detection system which uses a camera placed in front of the user is more suitable to be use but the physical signs that will indicate drowsiness and fatigue need to be located first in order to come up with a somnolence detection algorithm that is reliable and accurate. This system uses cameras and computer vision algorithms to analyze facial features and eye movements of the user. Lighting intensity and while the user tilt their face left or right are the problems occur during detection of eyes and mouth region. Therefore, this project aims to analyse all the previous research and method, hence propose a method to detect somnolence and fatigue by using a camera sensor. It analyzes the video images that have been recorded and come up with a system that can analyze each frame of the video.
In general, there are four types of drowsiness detection measurement techniques to detect fatigue of a people this can be done in four different ways:
Physiological Monitoring Systems: These systems monitor physiological signals such as heart rate, eye movement, brain activity (using EEG - Electroencephalogram), muscle activity, and skin conductance to detect signs of somnolence. Changes in these signals can indicate drowsiness or fatigue.
Behavioral Monitoring Systems: These systems analyze user behaviour to detect signs of somnolence such as drooping eyelids, eye closure, facial expression, perclos and head nods. These systems typically use sensors or cameras to observe actions of a people by continuously monitoring these behavioural cues, these systems can provide early warnings to individuals, allowing them to take preventive measures such as taking a break, drinking caffeine, or engaging in stimulating activities.
Subjective measures: Subjective measures of somnolence detection involve self-reporting or subjective evaluation of drowsy levels by individuals. These measures rely on the individual's own perception and assessment of their alertness and level of drowsy. Some common subjective measures of drowsiness detection include Questionnaires, Visual Analog Scales (VAS), Self-Report Scales, Subjective Evaluation, Performance Decline Assessment.
Vehicle Based Measures: These systems analyze the vehicle's trajectory and control inputs to detect deviations from normal driving behaviour, such as steering wheel movements, lane deviation, vehicle speed, and braking patterns that may indicate drowsiness. For example, sudden changes in speed or drifting out of lane without signalling can be indicative of a drowsy driver.
